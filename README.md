# genai-labs

Personal laboratory for exploring **Generative AI**, **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, **Agentic systems**, and **LLM development** using **Python**.

This repository follows a structured progression:

- 🧪 **Small hands-on exercises**  
- 🧱 **More solid Proofs of Concept (PoCs)**  
- 🚀 **Foundation blocks for real-world implementations or starter templates**

My goal is to build a clear, well-organized portfolio of GenAI, MCP, and agentic experiments—while capturing my learning journey end-to-end.

## 🔥 Focus Areas

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**
- **Agentic patterns & tool‑calling workflows**
- **Advanced LLM usage (prompts, context strategies, evals)**
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
- **Observability & tooling for AI systems**

All projects use **Python**, and each lab is self-contained.
